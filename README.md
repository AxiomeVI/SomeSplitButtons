# SomeSplitButtons

Inspired by [WonderMods](https://github.com/WonderGinger/WonderMods)

## Save and Quit Split
Add a menu button to unpause and split the room timer (after 31 frames) for practicing segments that end with S&Q

## Skip Cutscene Split
Add a menu button to unpause and split the room timer (after 18 frames) for practicing end of chapter cutscene skips as if under filetime condition

If the `Prologue` option is enableb, the timer waits 232 frames before splitting instead of the usual 18 frames fadeout for end of chapter cutscene

The `Number of cutscenes to ignore` option is used to ignore the first n cutscenes within the segment
